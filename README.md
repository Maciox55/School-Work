# School-Work

This repository contains most of my personal school assignments that I have completed, along with their prompts.  

If you happen to have the same assignments, or take the same courses I took, make sure that you are familiar with plagiarism policy at your university/college
before submitting this code as your own work.

You are free to use the code as reference, help or anything else that you might find my work to be helpful. Not every file is completely commented or documented.
